# Relevant data files:

* battles.csv -- contains most of the information about battles
* battle_durations.csv -- battle length
- 1 to 1 correspondence
* belligerents.csv -- information about the battle capacities of each combatant
- Many to 1 correspondence
* battle_dyads.csv -- information about win/loss?
- 1 to 1 correspondence
* terrain.csv -- terrain data
- 1 to 1
* weather.csv -- weather data
- 1 to 1

Other files have data that doesn't seem very useful for classification purposes, ex. general names, combatant names.
