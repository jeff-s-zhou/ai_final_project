  The actors associated with belligerents in each battle.
  Each side of a battle (belligerent) can include forces from one or more actors, which
  can be states or non-states. This table lists those actors. The names of the actors 
  don't correspond to any particular list of state or non-state actors since no list that
  I am aware of goes back to the 17th century. However, an effort is made to use the COW names
  of states for state actors in battles after 1816.
