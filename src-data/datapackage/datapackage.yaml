description:  "A database of over 600 battles that were fought between 1600AD and 1973AD. Descriptive data include battle name, date, and location; the strengths and losses on each side; identification of the victor; temporal duration of the battle; and selected environmental and tactical environment descriptors (such as type of fortifications, type of tactical scheme, weather conditions, width of front, etc.)\nThis dataset is a revised, cleaned, expanded and packaged version of Helmbold's CDB90 data. However, it does not add any new battles to the data."
